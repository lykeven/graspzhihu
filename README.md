# graspzhihu
a simple node.js program to grasp zhihu information 
This is a program used to grasp information of zhihu that coded by node,js.

in the program,I use some modules of node,js :
1.request     for http request.
2.cherrio     for matching the information that I want to grasp by css selector like jquery.
3.mysql       for connecting to mysql and adding data to the database.
4.async       for changing asynchronous flow to synchronization.
5.zlib        for solve the problem that the website zhihu use gzip formation to protect data from scrawling
6.iconv-lite  for solve the program that the coding mode is not compatible with what I want to use.
